# why

I need synthetic data of interactions that lead to a meeting and those that don't to measure the effectiveness of what ever approach I try and the more closer it is to real life the better.

# Scenarios for meeting

- Technical 
    - want to brainstorm approach
    - facing issues with parts of the codebase that the team member has more context on
    - brain scratching technical issues like database migration gone bad or unknown merge conflicts
    - production hot fixes
- Team operations proposal
    - sprint plannng discussion
    - feedback discussions (one-on-one)
    - roadmap plannning
- Client meeting proposal
    - feedback on a presentation
    - how to showcase particular edge cases being handled
    - dry run of demos
    - team lead proposes a meeting after a client call to discuss next steps

# Types of scheduling

- Quick sync up
- Planned meetings
- Rescheduling

# Noise
The messages are coming in from a group chat environment like IRC, slack etc thus should contain some noise like,
- non contextual message coming in between a message chain containing the request
- interleaved parallel conversation
