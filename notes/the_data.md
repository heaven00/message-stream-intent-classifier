# Capturing data for understanding

`uv run python client.py ws://143.110.238.245:8000/stream > stream_capture.jsonl`

# Notes

- The data seems to be an IRC channel (this brings back memories)
- The text is a mixture of emojis, user_id mentions 
- they are in order, but there are multiple conversations going on and at varying topics .i.e. there is a lot of noise in the data
- There are a lot of conversations, some starting, continuing and dying or someone restarting an older conversation, since this is all asychronous conversation


## Next steps
- take a tea break -> research -> and decide on how to decompose the problem
