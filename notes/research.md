# Detecting Conversations

This problem is called **conversation disentanglement**

- dataset: https://github.com/jkkummerfeld/irc-disentanglement 


## Overall understanding of conversation disentanglement

- we are looking at message pairs and classifying whether they are part of the same converation or not
- though how do they handle delayed async messages? more reading required


- Looking at the data some of the patterns for disentanglement
    - indivduals usually reply to particular users
    - the ones starting a conversations usually start with hi etc and then ask a question

Session -> a conversation that is going on

Whenever a message flows in, it can either 
- start a new session
- add to an existing session
    - when adding they usually mention one of the users in the session

people do type the whole message in parts, so need to take that into account

**Update (25th Feb)**
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.12646v2 - this introduces a MLP (multi layer perceptron) over Bert style models to

It does make certain assumption about the underlying system in place which would need more looking into, but can wait for now.

## Alternative approach

build a binary classifier to say whether there is intent to meet on a virtual call or not
- generate dummy conversational data using LLMs for these conversations
- build a classifier
- test it out on the stream

this approach focuses only on the problem at hand and narrows down the scope of things to be done.
